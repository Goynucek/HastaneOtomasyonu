This is a Hospital Automation project. There are four different membership types: Admin, Moderator, Technical Staff, and Doctor. Admins add Institutions and Moderators. Moderators add Staff, Outpatient Clinics, and Clinics. They can also perform all the actions that Technical Staff can. Technical Staff handle Patient Registration and Appointment processes. They can also access the list of patients currently waiting in line at the hospital and cancel appointments. Doctors see all patients waiting in line in their clinic. They can access their previous appointments and past diagnoses in the same clinic and can also diagnose patients.
